Before you start, make sure you have Git installed in your machine! If you don't, the instructions are listed below.

## A - Installing `Git` a Mac device
Usually, `git` commands are installed by default in all Linux and Mac OSs.

In case they don't, follow the the below steps:
- Visit `Git`'s official page to Download `Git` on [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads); click on the `Mac OS X` button to Download the right package.
- Open the downloaded file, and follow through the steps (Click 'Install' to go through the standard installation)
- Open your Mac Terminal by searching for `Terminal` in the Apps tab, or go to `Dock > Launch Pad > Other > Terminal`
- Run the command `git --version` (which prints the current `Git` version); the version displayed should match the one you just installed.
Congratulations! You have installed `Git` correctly.

## B - Installing `Git` on a Windows device
To run the `Git` commands on Windows, users must download the `Git bash` application (which provides a command prompt that understands `Git` commands). Download it on [this link](https://gitforwindows.org/).
